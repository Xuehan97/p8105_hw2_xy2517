# Problem 1

**Read and clean the Mr.Trash Wheel sheet.**

``` r
trashwheel = 
  read_excel(path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls,0)) %>%  # round sports_balls to integer
  rename(weight = weight_tons, volumn = volume_cubic_yards) %>%  # change column name
  drop_na(dumpster)

head(trashwheel,3) %>% knitr::kable()
```

**Read and clean 2018 and 2019 precipitation data.**

``` r
rain_2019 = 
  read_excel(path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2019 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total,month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)

rain_2018 = 
  read_excel(path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total,month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)
```

**Combine the rain\_2018 and rain\_2019 together.**

``` r
precipitation = bind_rows(rain_2018,rain_2019) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>%  # change numeric month name to character
  relocate(year,month)

head(precipitation,3) %>% knitr::kable()
```

| year | month    | total |
|-----:|:---------|------:|

# Problem 2

**Clean the data in pols-month.**

``` r
pols = read_csv(file = "./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"),"-" ) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)], president = ifelse(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop"), year = as.integer(year)) %>% # Replace char month with full name
  select(-prez_dem,-prez_gop,-day)

head(pols,3) %>% knitr::kable()
```

**Clean the data in snp.csv.**

Separate data into year, month and day. Then delete day and change year
to a 4 digit form.

``` r
snp_raw = read_csv(file = "./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date,into = c( "month", "day", "year"),"/") %>%
  select(-day) %>% # remove day column
  mutate(year = ifelse(as.integer(year) <= 15,as.integer(year) + 2000,as.integer(year) + 1900)) # it can be run just once.
```

Arrange year and month, then replace numeric month name with full name.

``` r
snp = snp_raw %>% 
  arrange(as.integer(year),as.integer(month)) %>% # change character into int , then arrange
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>% 
  relocate(year,month) # let year and month be the leading variable

head(snp,3) %>% knitr::kable()
```

| year | month    | close |
|-----:|:---------|------:|
| 1950 | January  | 17.05 |
| 1950 | February | 17.22 |
| 1950 | March    | 17.29 |

**Tidy the unemployment data.**

``` r
unemployment = read_csv(file = "./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "percentage"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(month = replace(month,month == month.abb, month.name)) %>%  #replace abbreviation to full month name using Replace()
  janitor::clean_names()

head(unemployment,3) %>% knitr::kable()
```

| year | month    | percentage |
|-----:|:---------|-----------:|
| 1948 | January  |        3.4 |
| 1948 | February |        3.8 |
| 1948 | March    |        4.0 |

**Join the three datasets together.**

``` r
merge_df = left_join(pols, snp, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))

tail(merge_df,3) %>% knitr::kable()
```

  select(year_of_birth, ethnicity,rank) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year_of_birth,
    values_from = rank

most_pop_male = pull(male,childs_first_name)[1]
```

**Display the rank of the most popular male name ethan with year and
ethnicity.**

``` r

**Scatterplot showing the number of children with a name against the
rank in popularity of the name.**

Firstly, select the target subdatasets.

``` r
plot_df = baby_names %>%

```

Then,draw plots between number of children with a name and rank in
popularity.

``` r
num_popularity_plot = 
  ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = rank, y = count)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = "Red")) +
  xlab("Rank in popularity") +
  ylab("The number of Children with this name") +
  ggtitle("Tendency of the number of children with the popularity of of name") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
