# Problem 1

**Read and clean the Mr.Trash Wheel sheet.**

``` r
trashwheel = read_excel(path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls,0)) %>%  # round sports_balls to integer
  rename(weight = weight_tons, volumn = volume_cubic_yards) %>%  # change column name
  pivot_longer(
    plastic_bottles:sports_balls,
    names_to = "trash_type",
    values_to = "units"
  ) %>%  # turn trash types into a variable
  drop_na(dumpster)
```

**Read and clean 2018 and 2019 precipitation data.**

``` r
rain_2019 = read_excel(path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2019 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total,month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)

rain_2018 = read_excel(path = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total,month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)
```

**Combine the rain\_2018 and rain\_2019 together.**

``` r
precipitation = bind_rows(rain_2018,rain_2019) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) # change numeric month name to character
```

**Description:**

-   As for trashwheel, there are total 2408 observations, 9 variables
    including dumpster, month, year, date, weight, volumn,
